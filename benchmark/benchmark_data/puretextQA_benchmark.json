They often show a uniform signal intensity on MRI and low to moderate FDG uptake on PET scans.\n  - **Malignant Tumours**: Often appear irregularly shaped, with poorly defined margins, and may exhibit heterogeneity in signal intensity due to necrosis, haemorrhage, or infiltration of surrounding tissues. They usually demonstrate higher FDG uptake on PET scans, reflecting increased metabolic activity.\n\nThese imaging characteristics guide clinical management by helping to determine the need for biopsy, the extent of surgical resection, and the necessity for postoperative surveillance. For instance, a tumour with high peripheral signal intensity and low central signal intensity, as seen in this case, might prompt further investigation to rule out malignancy, possibly through fine-needle aspiration biopsy or additional imaging studies.",

In contrast, true coarctation involves a discrete narrowing of the aorta, typically at the isthmus. Imaging findings that differentiate pseudocoarctation from true coarctation include the presence of an elongated aortic arch that does not show a significant reduction in caliber, and the absence of a true stenotic segment. Additionally, in pseudocoarctation, the isthmic portion of the descending aorta is not adjacent to the spine and is surrounded by aerated lung tissue, which is not typically seen in true coarctation. These imaging characteristics are crucial for surgical planning, as they guide the type of repair needed. For pseudocoarctation, surgical correction may involve resection of the elongated arch and end-to-end anastomosis, whereas true coarctation might require a different approach, such as subclavian flap or patch augmentation, depending on the extent and location of the narrowing.",
