    "question": "How does the presence of newborn neurons (Tuj-1+ cells) in the lesion site of canines treated with the NeuroRegen scaffold combined with MSCs compare to other groups, and what does this indicate about neuroregeneration?",
    "reference_answer": "The NeuroRegen scaffold combined with MSCs resulted in a significantly higher number of newborn neurons (Tuj-1+ cells) in the lesion site compared to the control and non-functionalized scaffold groups. This indicates enhanced neurogenesis and suggests that the combination therapy promotes neural regeneration and potentially improves functional recovery.",
    "prediction": "The presence of newborn neurons (Tuj-1+ cells) in the lesion site of canines treated with the NeuroRegen scaffold combined with MSCs is significantly higher compared to the control group and the group treated with the NeuroRegen scaffold alone. This indicates that the combination of the NeuroRegen scaffold and MSCs enhances neuroregeneration more effectively than either treatment alone. The increased number of Tuj-1+ cells suggests a more robust regenerative response, likely due to the synergistic effects of the scaffold providing structural support and the MSCs contributing to cellular regeneration and differentiation.",

    "question": "How does the distribution of CD11c+ dendritic cells correlate with the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the compound figure?",
    "reference_answer": "The distribution of CD11c+ dendritic cells correlates with the severity of EAE. In mice with more severe EAE, there is increased accumulation of DCs in CNS lesions, particularly around blood vessels and demyelinating areas marked by anti-MBP antibodies. This suggests that DCs migrate to CNS lesions in response to inflammation, potentially contributing to antigen presentation and disease progression.",
    "prediction": "The distribution of CD11c+ dendritic cells, as visualized in the compound figure, shows a clear correlation with the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In Image A, where the EAE score is 0.5, there is minimal presence of CD11c+ dendritic cells, indicating a lower severity of the disease. In Image B, with an EAE score of 2.5, there is a noticeable increase in the number of CD11c+ dendritic cells, suggesting a moderate severity of EAE. Finally, in Image C, where the EAE score is 5.0, there is a significant accumulation of CD11c+ dendritic cells, indicating a high severity of the disease. This pattern suggests that as the severity of EAE increases, there is a corresponding increase in the infiltration of CD11c+ dendritic cells into the spinal cord, which may play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease.",

The surgical interventions included median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, and aortic root replacement with a 19-mm SJM Regent valve. Postoperative 3D CT imaging confirmed successful repair but also noted slight stenosis of the innominate artery and abdominal aorta shrinkage.",
    "prediction": "The key findings in the intraoperative imaging (Fig-0a and Fig-0b) include the presence of an aneurysm in the ascending aorta, as indicated by the black arrows. The surgical intervention involved the use of a Dacron graft to replace the affected segment of the aorta. The postoperative imaging (Fig-0c and Fig-0d) confirms the successful placement of the Dacron graft, with no residual aneurysm observed. The 3D reconstruction (Fig-0e) provides a detailed view of the repaired aorta, showing the integration of the graft with the native aortic tissue. These images collectively demonstrate the effectiveness of the surgical procedure in addressing the aneurysm and restoring the structural integrity of the aorta.",

    "question": "What are the consequences of HCP-6 depletion on chromosome segregation during meiosis I and II in *C. elegans*?",
    "reference_answer": "Depletion of HCP-6 leads to the formation of DNA bridges between segregating chromosomes during anaphase stages of both meiosis I and II, resulting in defective chromosome segregation. This effect is more pronounced during meiosis II, indicating that condensin is crucial for proper homologue segregation in meiosis I but is even more critical for sister chromatid segregation in meiosis II.",
    "prediction": "The depletion of HCP-6 in *C. elegans* leads to significant defects in chromosome segregation during both meiosis I and II. In meiosis I, HCP-6 depletion results in the failure of homologous chromosomes to segregate properly, as evidenced by the presence of both homologous chromosomes in the same daughter cell. This missegregation is indicated by the arrows in the images. Similarly, during meiosis II, HCP-6 depletion causes sister chromatids to fail to segregate correctly, resulting in both sister chromatids being present in the same daughter cell. These defects highlight the critical role of HCP-6 in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis, and its depletion disrupts this process, leading to aneuploidy and potential fertility issues in the organism.",

    "reference_answer": "Single-voxel thresholding depicts the histologic tumor fraction more accurately than the mean rCBV from nine-voxel ROIs. It provides a nine-fold higher spatial resolution and better captures the variability in rCBV values, leading to a more precise identification of tumor subregions within biopsy samples.",
    "prediction": "The comparison between single-voxel thresholding and mean relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) from nine-voxel regions of interest (ROIs) in depicting the histologic tumor fraction in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) biopsies reveals significant differences. Single-voxel thresholding tends to overestimate the histologic tumor fraction, as seen in Figure 2A, where the thresholded area is larger than the actual histologic tumor area. In contrast, mean rCBV from nine-voxel ROIs provides a more accurate representation of the histologic tumor fraction, as shown in Figure 2B. This method reduces the overestimation seen with single-voxel thresholding and aligns more closely with the actual histologic findings. The use of nine-voxel ROIs allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the tumor's vascular characteristics, leading to a more precise correlation with the histologic tumor fraction. This suggests that multi-voxel approaches, such as mean rCBV from nine-voxel ROIs, are superior in accurately depicting the histologic tumor fraction in recurrent GBM biopsies compared to single-voxel thresholding.",

Actin is a crucial component of the cytoskeleton and plays a vital role in various cellular functions, including cell motility, adhesion, and morphogenesis. The presence of apical ruffles, which are dynamic protrusions at the apical surface of the cells, indicates active remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in response to the micro-patterned environment. These ruffles are likely involved in processes such as cell spreading, migration, and adhesion to the underlying substrate. By analyzing the formation, dynamics, and behavior of these apical ruffles over time, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how cells sense and respond to their microenvironment, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms governing actin dynamics and cytoskeletal reorganization.

    "reference_answer": "The autopsy findings included a massive right pulmonary hemorrhagic infarct caused by pulmonary thromboemboli, extensive pleural adhesions, and a hypertrophied left ventricle with a fibrocalcific constrictive annular band, all of which contributed to determining the cause of death.",
    "prediction": "The key findings from the autopsy that contributed to determining the cause of death in Fig-0 include the presence of a large, irregularly shaped mass in the thoracic cavity, which appears to be a tumor. This mass has caused significant compression and displacement of the surrounding organs, including the heart and lungs. The heart shows signs of hypertrophy, likely due to the increased workload from the compression. Additionally, there are areas of hemorrhage and necrosis within the tumor, indicating its aggressive nature. These findings suggest that the tumor was the primary cause of death, likely due to its size and the resultant pressure on vital organs, leading to compromised cardiac and respiratory function.",

    "reference_answer": "The compound figure shows that amyloid fibrils have a cross-β-sheet structure with β-strands forming intermolecular β-sheets orthogonal to the fiber axis. Negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) visualizes these fibrils, revealing their characteristic morphology and organization. This visualization technique helps in understanding the molecular architecture of amyloid fibrils and their roles in biological processes, such as biofilm formation.",
    "prediction": "The compound figure provides detailed insights into the structural characteristics and visualization techniques of amyloid fibrils. Part A of the figure shows a schematic representation of amyloid fibrils, highlighting the interstrand distance of -4.7 Å and the intersheet distance of -10 Å. These measurements are crucial for understanding the molecular packing and stability of the fibrils. Part B of the figure presents transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of various amyloid fibrils, including PSMα1, CsgA, FapC, and TsaA. The TEM images reveal the distinct morphologies of these fibrils, with PSMα1 showing a network-like structure, CsgA displaying a dense fibrillar pattern, FapC exhibiting a more fibrous appearance, and TsaA presenting a less defined structure. These visualizations are essential for studying the physical properties and potential functional roles of amyloid fibrils in different biological contexts.",

HMB supplementation partially mitigates this effect, resulting in 85 ± 4% contractile material in the BoNT-A+HMB group.

    "prediction": "Onabotulinumtoxin-A (BoNT-A) injection significantly reduces the percentage of contractile material in muscle tissue, as evidenced by the decreased staining intensity in the BoNT-A group compared to the control group. This reduction indicates a loss of muscle contractility. However, HMB supplementation appears to mitigate this effect. In the BoNT-A + HMB group, the percentage of contractile material is higher than in the BoNT-A group but still lower than in the control group. This suggests that HMB supplementation helps preserve muscle contractility to some extent, although it does not fully restore it to the levels seen in the control group.",

Both cell types have apical microvilli and basal nuclei, and tight junctions are present in both, but the absence of desmosomes and basal membranes in the mutated cells indicates impaired cell-to-cell adhesion and polarization.",
    "prediction": "In the compound figure, significant structural differences are observed between control and PRPF31-mutated iRPE cells. The control iRPE cells (panels a, c, e, g, i) exhibit well-organized and intact cellular structures, with clear and distinct organelles. In contrast, the PRPF31-mutated iRPE cells (panels b, d, f, h, j) show signs of cellular stress and damage. These include disrupted organelle integrity, increased vacuolization, and the presence of cellular debris. The higher magnification images (panels c, d, f, g, h, i, j) further highlight these differences, with the PRPF31-mutated cells displaying more pronounced structural abnormalities compared to the control cells.

    "reference_answer": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment leads to a significant increase in GPR120 expression in hepatocytes of pediatric NAFLD patients. This finding suggests that DHA might have a therapeutic role in managing NAFLD by enhancing GPR120 expression, which is associated with improved lipid metabolism and reduced inflammation.",
    "prediction": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment significantly increases the expression of GPR120 in pediatric NAFLD patients. This is evident from the immunohistochemical staining, which shows a marked upregulation of GPR120 in the post-treatment samples compared to the baseline. The increased expression of GPR120 suggests that DHA may exert its therapeutic effects through the modulation of this receptor. GPR120 is known to play a role in anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing pathways, which are crucial in managing NAFLD. Therefore, the upregulation of GPR120 by DHA treatment indicates a potential mechanism by which DHA can improve liver function and reduce inflammation in NAFLD patients. This finding supports the use of DHA as a therapeutic agent in pediatric NAFLD and highlights the importance of targeting GPR120 in future treatment strategies.",

    "prediction": "The presence of *Legionella pneumophila* significantly impacts the digestion process of *Wolbachia magna*, as evidenced in the compound image. In the image, *Wolbachia magna* cells that are co-infected with *Legionella pneumophila* (indicated by the presence of red fluorescence) show a distinct pattern of digestion compared to those not co-infected. Specifically, the co-infected *Wolbachia magna* cells exhibit more intense and widespread red fluorescence, suggesting that *Legionella pneumophila* accelerates or enhances the digestion process of *Wolbachia magna*. This is likely due to the interaction between the two bacterial species, where *Legionella pneumophila* may produce factors that facilitate the breakdown of *Wolbachia magna* cellular components, leading to more efficient digestion. This observation is crucial for understanding the dynamics of bacterial co-infections and their impact on cellular processes.",

In contrast, the combined treatment group (CMBG) shows mildly thickened basement membranes, average germinal lining with full spermatogenesis, and normal interstitium with average Leydig cells, indicating partial restoration of normal testicular function.",
    "prediction": "The histological features of the seminiferous tubules show significant differences between the cisplatin-treated group and the combined treatment group (CMBG). In the cisplatin-treated group, the seminiferous tubules exhibit severe atrophy, with a marked reduction in the number of spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. The tubules appear shrunken and disorganized, indicating substantial damage to the testicular tissue. In contrast, the combined treatment group (CMBG) shows a notable improvement in the histological structure of the seminiferous tubules. The tubules in this group are better preserved, with a higher number of spermatogonia and Sertoli cells compared to the cisplatin-treated group.

This localization pattern was confirmed through immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy, highlighting how varying expression levels influence SK2's subcellular distribution and functional roles.",

In cells with low SK2 overexpression, SK2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm. However, as the level of SK2 overexpression increases, there is a notable translocation of SK2 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. This is evidenced by the increased colocalization of SK2 (red) with the plasma membrane marker (green) in cells with high SK2 overexpression. Quantitative analysis further supports this observation, showing a significant increase in the percentage of SK2 colocalized with the plasma membrane in cells with high SK2 overexpression compared to those with low SK2 overexpression.",

PolyP induces even more extensive multilayered cell outgrowth. In contrast, under control conditions without any supplements, minimal cell outgrowth is observed. These findings highlight the role of HPL and polyP in promoting cellular proliferation and migration, which is crucial for understanding ocular surface regeneration.",

On day 1, the HPL and polyP treated explants exhibit a denser and more organized epithelial layer than the control. By day 2, this effect is more pronounced, with the HPL and polyP treated explants showing a substantial increase in epithelial cell density and organization. By day 3, the epithelial layer in the HPL and polyP treated explants is markedly thicker and more structured compared to the control.

    "question": "How does dose modulation affect the image quality and radiation exposure during MDCT imaging of the left ventricle as shown in Fig-0?",
    "reference_answer": "Dose modulation in MDCT imaging reduces radiation exposure by adjusting the tube current during acquisition. It maintains high-quality images during the end-diastolic phase when the tube current is maximal but results in increased image noise in the end-systolic phase due to reduced tube current. This technique effectively balances image quality and radiation dose management.",
    "prediction": "Dose modulation significantly impacts both image quality and radiation exposure in MDCT imaging of the left ventricle, as demonstrated in Fig-0. In Fig-0A, without dose modulation, the image exhibits higher noise levels, which can obscure fine details of the left ventricle's structure. This higher noise level is a result of increased radiation exposure, which is necessary to achieve sufficient image clarity. Conversely, in Fig-0B, with dose modulation, the image quality is markedly improved, showing clearer and more detailed visualization of the left ventricle with reduced noise. This improvement is achieved by optimizing the radiation dose, thereby lowering the patient's exposure to radiation while maintaining or enhancing the diagnostic quality of the image. This balance is crucial in clinical settings to ensure patient safety while obtaining high-quality diagnostic images.",

    "reference_answer": "The key histological findings in Fig-0 include hyperplastic cystic lining epithelium, inflamed connective tissue capsule, multinucleated giant cells, hyaline rings, and implanted vegetable/plant material confirmed by PAS-positive staining. These findings indicate a chronic inflammatory response and granulomatous reaction to foreign material, which are critical for diagnosing a paradental cyst with a foreign body reaction and guiding appropriate clinical management.",
    "prediction": "The key histological findings in the diagnosis of the paradental cyst, as shown in Fig-0, include the presence of non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium lining the cyst. This type of epithelium is characteristic of paradental cysts and helps differentiate them from other cystic lesions. Additionally, the cyst wall is composed of dense fibrous connective tissue, which is typical for this type of cyst. The clinical significance of these findings lies in their ability to confirm the diagnosis of a paradental cyst, which is important for determining the appropriate treatment plan. The presence of non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium suggests a benign nature of the cyst, and the dense fibrous connective tissue indicates that the cyst is well-encapsulated, reducing the likelihood of recurrence after surgical removal.",

By representing varying degrees of echogenicity with distinct colors, these contours allow for the accurate measurement and comparison of tendon structure. The relative percentages of different echo-types provide insights into the tendon's structural integrity and any potential pathological changes, aiding in both diagnostic and research purposes.",
    "prediction": "The use of contours and specific echo-types in cross-sectional views significantly enhances the assessment of patellar tendon structure by providing a clear demarcation of the tendon boundaries and detailed visualization of its internal composition. In the provided images, the green contour outlines the patellar tendon, allowing for precise measurement of its dimensions and identification of any structural abnormalities. The different echo-types, represented by varying colors, help in distinguishing between different tissue densities and compositions within the tendon. This detailed visualization is crucial for diagnosing conditions such as tendinopathy, where changes in the internal structure of the tendon can be indicative of disease progression or response to treatment. By analyzing these images, clinicians can obtain a comprehensive understanding of the tendon's health and make informed decisions regarding patient management.",

    "reference_answer": "Sustained expression of D-GADD45 increases apoptosis and reduces disc size in wing imaginal discs. The JNK pathway is activated by D-GADD45 upregulation, and inhibiting JNK reduces apoptosis, indicating that JNK is crucial for D-GADD45-induced cell death.",
    "prediction": "Sustained expression of D-GADD45 in wing imaginal discs leads to a significant increase in cell death, as evidenced by the high number of TUNEL-positive cells. This indicates that prolonged activation of D-GADD45 is detrimental to cell survival. The JNK pathway plays a crucial role in this process. When the JNK pathway is activated, it exacerbates the cell death induced by D-GADD45. Conversely, inhibiting the JNK pathway reduces the cell death caused by D-GADD45. This suggests that the JNK pathway is a key mediator of the cell death response triggered by sustained D-GADD45 expression. Therefore, targeting the JNK pathway could be a potential strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of prolonged D-GADD45 activation in wing imaginal discs.",

There is no leakage or obstruction, although there is slight narrowing at the upper anastomosis and delayed larynx emptying. The mucosa is smooth, and the lower edge of the anastomosis is spacious and free of ulceration. Overall, these findings indicate functional recovery with minor issues.",
    "prediction": "The series of imaging tests in Fig-0 provides a comprehensive evaluation of the esophageal anastomosis post-surgery. The barium swallow test in Fig-0(a) shows a smooth passage of barium through the esophagus, indicating that the anastomosis is patent and there are no immediate obstructions or leaks. The esophagogram in Fig-0(b) further confirms the integrity of the anastomosis with a clear outline of the esophageal lumen. The chest X-ray in Fig-0(c) does not show any signs of complications such as pneumomediastinum or pleural effusion, suggesting that the surgical site is stable. Finally, the endoscopic image in Fig-0(d) provides a direct visual confirmation of the anastomotic site, showing a well-healed mucosal surface without signs of inflammation, ulceration, or stenosis. Together, these images indicate a successful surgical outcome with a well-functioning esophageal anastomosis.",

    "reference_answer": "The confocal and DIC images in Fig-0 provide a comprehensive view of MIP-GFP localization within *S. cerevisiae*. Confocal micrographs highlight the fluorescence of MIP-GFP, indicating its presence in internal membranes, cell walls, and the extracellular environment. The DIC images, when merged with the fluorescent images, enhance the visualization of cellular structures, thereby providing a detailed and precise analysis of MIP-GFP's spatial distribution within the yeast cells.",
    "prediction": "The confocal and DIC images in Fig-0 provide complementary information that enhances our understanding of MIP-GFP localization within *S. cerevisiae* cells. The confocal image (Fig-0A) clearly shows the green fluorescence of MIP-GFP, indicating its presence and distribution within the cells. The DIC image (Fig-0B) offers a detailed view of the cell morphology, allowing us to see the structural context in which MIP-GFP is localized. By merging these images (Fig-0C), we can precisely correlate the fluorescence signal with specific cellular structures, confirming that MIP-GFP is localized within the cytoplasm of the yeast cells. This combined imaging approach is crucial for accurately determining the subcellular localization of proteins and understanding their functional roles within the cell.",

H&E staining shows no significant morphological differences or inflammation between Muc4 KO and wild-type (WT) mice, confirming the integrity of the corneal and conjunctival epithelia.",

In the X-gal staining (Panel A), the WT cornea shows no blue staining, indicating the absence of β-galactosidase activity. In contrast, the Muc4 KO cornea exhibits extensive blue staining, indicating high levels of β-galactosidase activity, which is a marker of Muc4 expression. This suggests that Muc4 is highly expressed in the KO cornea. The H&E staining (Panel B) shows that the WT cornea has a normal, well-organized epithelial and stromal structure. However, the Muc4 KO cornea displays significant structural abnormalities, including disrupted epithelial layers and stromal disorganization, indicating that Muc4 plays a crucial role in maintaining corneal structure and integrity.

    "reference_answer": "The imaging findings in Fig-0, including CT and T2-weighted MRI, provide critical information for staging bladder cancer. CT reveals left hydronephrosis, indicating urinary obstruction, a bladder tumor on the right lateral wall with invasion into the surrounding fibroadipose tissue, and right external iliac lymph node involvement, suggesting regional metastasis. These findings support the staging of cT3bN1M0, indicating muscle-invasive disease with nodal involvement. This comprehensive assessment guides the selection of appropriate systemic chemotherapy and local management strategies to address both the primary tumor and metastatic disease.",
    "prediction": "The imaging findings in Fig-0 play a crucial role in the staging and treatment planning of the patient with bladder cancer. In Fig-0A, the axial CT scan shows a large, irregularly shaped mass in the bladder, which is indicative of a high-grade urothelial carcinoma. The presence of multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the pelvic region suggests lymph node involvement, which is a critical factor in determining the stage of the cancer. In Fig-0B, the sagittal CT scan provides a detailed view of the tumor's extent and its relationship with surrounding structures, including the bladder wall and adjacent organs. This information is essential for surgical planning, as it helps in assessing the feasibility of complete tumor resection and the need for neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies. Additionally, the identification of lymph node involvement may necessitate a more extensive surgical approach or the inclusion of lymphadenectomy in the treatment plan. Overall, these imaging findings help in accurately staging the cancer, which is vital for determining the most appropriate and effective treatment strategy for the patient.",

    "reference_answer": "RNA sequencing from the BCCAS mouse model reveals significant upregulation of genes such as Apoe, Cd33, and Ms4a clusters, along with APP-Aβ degradation genes, during subacute hypoperfusion. This upregulation correlates with microglia infiltration and reduced cerebral blood flow. Immunohistochemistry using markers like GFAP and IBA1 shows astrocytosis and microglia infiltration in the affected areas, indicating significant gliosis. These findings support the hypothesis that severe subacute hypoperfusion triggers APP misfolding and Aβ oligomer formation, particularly in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.",
    "prediction": "The key findings from RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry in the BCCAS mouse model indicate a significant upregulation of genes and proteins associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell death pathways. Specifically, there is an increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, as well as markers of oxidative stress like superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Additionally, proteins involved in apoptosis, such as caspase-3 and Bax, are also elevated. These molecular changes correlate with the observed ischemic lesions in the brain, which are characterized by areas of tissue damage and necrosis. The ischemic lesions are more pronounced in the BCCAS model compared to controls, suggesting that the upregulation of these genes and proteins contributes to the severity of the ischemic damage. This correlation underscores the role of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury in this model.",

This balance suggests a protective effect against graft degradation, aligning with the stable angiographic findings.",
    "prediction": "The balance of MMP-2 and TIMP expression in SVGD (-) patients is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the saphenous vein graft. MMP-2, a matrix metalloproteinase, is involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix components, which is necessary for normal tissue remodeling and repair. TIMP, on the other hand, inhibits the activity of MMPs, including MMP-2, thereby preventing excessive matrix degradation. In SVGD (-) patients, a balanced expression of MMP-2 and TIMP ensures that the extracellular matrix is adequately remodeled without excessive degradation, contributing to the stability and functionality of the saphenous vein graft. This balance prevents pathological changes such as intimal hyperplasia and graft failure, which are common complications in SVGD (+) patients where this balance is disrupted. Therefore, maintaining a proper MMP-2/TIMP ratio is essential for the long-term success of saphenous vein grafts in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures.",

    "question": "How do the temporal dynamics of inhibitory control differ between adolescents and adults, as depicted in Fig-0?",
    "reference_answer": "In the compound figure, adults exhibit earlier activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) between 200 and 250 ms, while adolescents show later activation of the left IFG between 250 and 300 ms. Additionally, adolescents display heightened activation in the right temporal and inferior parietal regions, indicating greater attentional demands during inhibitory control tasks. These differences highlight the immaturity of inhibitory control networks in adolescents compared to adults.",
    "prediction": "The temporal dynamics of inhibitory control, as depicted in Fig-0, show distinct patterns between adolescents and adults. In the 200-250 ms time window, both groups exhibit activation in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). However, in the 250-300 ms time window, there are notable differences. Adolescents show increased activation in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). In contrast, adults display activation in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG). These differences suggest that the neural mechanisms underlying inhibitory control evolve with age, with adolescents relying more on the ACC and IFG, while adults engage additional regions such as the SFG, indicating a more complex and possibly more efficient neural network for inhibitory control in adults.",
