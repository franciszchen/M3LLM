    "reference_answer": "Fig-7 is positioned to the left and below Fig-5 in the compound image.",
    "prediction": "In the compound image of the Alzheimer's disease patient's brain, Fig-7 and Fig-5 show a distinct spatial relationship. Fig-7, which highlights the presence of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, is predominantly located in the cortical regions of the brain. These plaques appear as bright, irregularly shaped deposits. On the other hand, Fig-5, which indicates the presence of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) tangles, is primarily found in the hippocampal region. The p-tau tangles are visible as bright, thread-like structures. This spatial distribution suggests that amyloid-beta plaques are more concentrated in the cortical areas, while phosphorylated tau tangles are more prevalent in the hippocampus. This pattern is consistent with the typical pathology observed in Alzheimer's disease, where amyloid-beta plaques are often found in the cortex and tau tangles in the hippocampus, contributing to the characteristic cognitive decline associated with the disease.",
