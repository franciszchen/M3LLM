However, the posterior-inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery remains unaffected and is clearly visible, marked by an arrow.

The mass demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement, with areas of both increased and decreased attenuation compared to the surrounding pancreatic parenchyma. Additionally, the mass appears to be in close proximity to the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and portal vein (PV), suggesting potential vascular involvement or encasement. These imaging characteristics are consistent with a pancreatic neoplasm, such as a pancreatic adenocarcinoma or neuroendocrine tumor. Further clinical and radiological correlation would be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis.",
